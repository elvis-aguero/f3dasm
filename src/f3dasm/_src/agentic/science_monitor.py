"""Science monitor: only the UNLEDGERED_EVALS runtime rule remains.

Hard invariants (EVIDENCE_DELEGATION_EXISTS, SUPPORTED_WITHOUT_ATTACK)
have been moved to the data boundary — HypothesisUpdate tool in
strategizer.py returns an error synchronously when violated.

Soft guidance rules (STALE_OPEN, UNANCHORED_DELEGATION, POSTERIOR_INERTIA)
have been removed from the runtime. They are covered by:
  - delegation-finish chores prompt (routing.py)
  - prompt guidance in the strategizer system prompt

EVIDENCE_NUMBERS_MATCH removed: too brittle — derived/reformatted values
legitimately appear in evidence without matching the report verbatim.
