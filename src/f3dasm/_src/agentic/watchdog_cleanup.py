"""Best-effort cleanup a study's run watchdog performs before ``os._exit``.

Two jobs, both observed-necessary on the n=5 watchdog post-mortems:
  1. ``reap_process_group`` — kill leftover background jobs the run spawned (e.g.
     an implementer's detached optimisation campaign) so they don't outlive the
     watchdog and keep burning CPU.
  2. ``write_watchdog_retrospective`` — a watchdog kill is abrupt, so the
     strategizer never writes its own end-of-run retrospective and §1 Step 1 is
     blind. Leave a synthetic, clearly-labelled post-mortem in
     ``retrospectives.jsonl`` from disk state.

Both are best-effort and never raise — a watchdog must still exit.
