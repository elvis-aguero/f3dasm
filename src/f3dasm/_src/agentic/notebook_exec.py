"""Execute the run deliverable — `pipeline.ipynb` — under the reproduction gate.

The system is committed to the notebook: `pipeline.ipynb` is THE deliverable.
The gate's contract (exit-clean + ZERO new oracle evals + the `REPRODUCED:`
headline grounded in the ledger) executes it lazily via nbclient. The nbclient/
nbformat/ipykernel deps ship with the `agentic` extra; `run_deliverable()`
returns a `subprocess.CompletedProcess`-shaped result and raises
`subprocess.TimeoutExpired` on timeout, so the gate branches on nothing.

Agents author the notebook cell-by-cell via the structured AddPipelineMarkdownCell
/ AddPipelineCell / EditPipelineCell / DeletePipelineCell / ShowNotebook closures
(pure nbformat, name-addressed) — there is no live kernel.
