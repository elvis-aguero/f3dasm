"""Pure logic for the #9 live hypothesis-verdict validator.

When the strategizer asserts a CLOSING verdict (SUPPORTED / FALSIFIED /
INCONCLUSIVE) via ``HypothesisUpdate``, an independent referee judges — live,
against the SAME charter the gate critic uses — whether the verdict's SUBSTANCE
obeys the Popperian rules: did the cited work severely test the registered
prediction (§2), does the verdict follow from the result (§3), and (for
FALSIFIED) does it rest on the same registered prediction with no goalpost-move
(§4).

The check is ADVISORY and NON-BLOCKING (the referee is a fallible LLM): its
critique lands in the tool result and persists on the verdict, but the update
always stands. This module holds only the pure, side-effect-free halves — the
prompt builder and the reply parser — so they are unit-testable without a model
or a node. The wiring (invoking the model, persisting the note, escalating) lives
in the HypothesisUpdate closure.

Check three things, each by clause number:
  1. §2 ATTEMPT ADEQUACY — did the cited work SEVERELY test the REGISTERED
     prediction (could it have refuted the claim had it been false), or is it a
     token / off-target probe?
  2. §3 VERDICT FOLLOWS — does {status} follow from the cited result?
     (adequate & contradicted -> FALSIFIED; adequate & survived -> SUPPORTED;
      inadequate or confounded -> INCONCLUSIVE.)
  3. §4 NO GOALPOST MOVE — if FALSIFIED, does it rest on the SAME registered
     prediction, not a post-hoc observation?

Reply in EXACTLY this format and nothing else:
SUBSTANCE: OK
— or —
SUBSTANCE: FLAG
CRITIQUE: <one or two sentences naming the clause and the concrete problem>

OK = all three checks pass. FLAG = at least one fails; the CRITIQUE must name the
clause and the specific problem. When genuinely unsure, prefer OK — this is
advisory and the strategizer stays in control."""
