"""Forward-compatible delegation-target resolution.

The strategizer names a delegation target; resolve_target maps it to a live
graph node by exact name, normalized name (case/separator-insensitive), or
normalized ROLE — surviving node renames as long as the role is stable. There
is NO hardcoded capability-synonym table: the root-cause fix is that the
strategizer prompt names targets by their hint/role, so it never invents a
'pipeline'/'oracle' target. An unresolvable target returns None (the caller
errors with the valid-target list, and the agent self-corrects).
