"""The reproduction gate cross-checks the notebook's STATED headline against
its COMPUTED one (lenient: only when both markers are printed).

Regression for run 20260705T181941: the write-up stated 0.3644 while an idxmax
cell printed a 0.3648 noise row as REPRODUCED, and the gate passed it for 4
rounds because it never compared the two.
