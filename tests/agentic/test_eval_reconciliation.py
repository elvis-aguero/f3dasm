"""Unit tests for _reconcile_delegation_evals (§3 honesty check).

The canonical store is the single source of truth for the eval count. When a
source is registered and a worker claimed evals but none are provenance-stamped
in the store, the delegation evaluated off-ledger: the truthful count is 0 and
the condition is flagged. These tests pin the branching in isolation by stubbing
the two store-reading helpers.
