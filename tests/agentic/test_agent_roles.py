"""Every specialist agent must declare its own role.

Regression for runs 20260708T021335 + 20260629T145434: LiteratureReviewAgent
and DebuggerAgent declared no `role`, so they inherited the base default
`Agent.role = "implementer"`. Every implementer-keyed branch then mis-fired on
them — most visibly the milestone-backlog nudge on delegations to the
literature_reviewer (diagnostics `MILESTONE_BLOCK node=literature_reviewer` in
both runs), and the Abaqus eval-parallelism resource nudge, and role telemetry.
A missing role must never impersonate the implementer.
