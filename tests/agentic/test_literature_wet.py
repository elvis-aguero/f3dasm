"""Wet integration test for LiteratureReviewAgent.

Runs a real delegation with actual LLM + arxiv MCP tools.
Marked `integration` — not run in CI, requires claude-agent-sdk + network.

Research question: Gaussian Process surrogate modeling for high-dimensional
design-of-experiments — directly relevant to f3dasm's core use case.

Run with:

# Research Problem: Surrogate Modelling for Design-of-Experiments

## Background
We are running a design-of-experiments campaign for a structural mechanics
optimisation problem. The design space is three-dimensional (continuous) and
evaluations are expensive (FEM simulations). We want to guide the search
using a surrogate model.

## Research questions for literature review
1. What Gaussian Process surrogate modelling strategies have been proposed
   for high-dimensional or expensive design-of-experiments problems?
2. What acquisition functions are recommended when the objective landscape
   has multiple local optima?
3. Has any prior work combined GP surrogates with physics-based constraints
   or coilability-type feasibility filters?

## Scope
Focus on methods published since 2015. Prefer papers with open-source
implementations or reproducible benchmarks.
"""

DELEGATION_TASK = """\
Answer the following research questions from primary literature.
Cite exact passages with page and paragraph references.
Do NOT answer from memory — every claim must come from a paper in the corpus.

Build a corpus of AT MOST 4 full-text papers (the most relevant ones).
Stop adding papers once 4 are in the corpus.
Prefer arXiv/open-access PDFs.
