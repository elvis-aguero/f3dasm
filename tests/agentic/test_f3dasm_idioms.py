"""CI gate: the canonical f3dasm idioms injected into agent prompts must
EXECUTE against the installed f3dasm. If an f3dasm API moves, this fails at
build time — so a broken API example can never ship to an agent (and no runtime
introspection is needed).

This is the mechanism behind the single-source design: F3DASM_CORE_IDIOMS lives
in one place, the prompts compose it in, and this test validates it.
