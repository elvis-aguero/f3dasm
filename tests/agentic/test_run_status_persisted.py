"""Regression: a NORMALLY-closed run left no debug/run_status.json — the gate
outcome was written only to the notebook metadata + the ledger, so the §1 analysis
protocol's first KPI (gate outcome ← run_status.json) was unreadable for every
clean run (3 GATED runs in a row had no run_status.json). The close path now
persists it via AgenticRun._write_run_status on every terminal state.
