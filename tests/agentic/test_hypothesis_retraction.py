"""Run-2 back door: the agent could not RETRACT its own premature verdict.

The strategizer marked H1/H3 SUPPORTED, then correctly realised (Charter §2) they
should be OPEN — no falsification ATTEMPT was made. HypothesisUpdate refused the
downgrade ("reopening requires new evidence with a 'delegation' key"), but at
close time there is no new delegation to cite → deadlock → a narrative-vs-ledger
contradiction the critic rejects on (run-2 UNGATED, CONSISTENCY_FLAG).

Fix: retracting a verdict to OPEN is WITHDRAWING a claim, not asserting one — it
carries forward the evidence the verdict was based on, no new delegation needed.
