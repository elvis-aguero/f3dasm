"""ConsultHandbook is injected UNIVERSALLY at adapter construction.

Every node's adapter must get the read-only handbook lookup equally, from the
single construction point (agent_runtime._make_adapter) — not duplicated per
worker/strategizer path, and not special-cased per agent. This pins that the
critic (invoked off the Delegate path) gets it just like a worker, and that the
tool is a runtime closure (its description owned by _consult_handbook), never
hardcoded into a prompt.
