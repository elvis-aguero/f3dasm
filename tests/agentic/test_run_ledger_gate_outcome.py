"""Regression: the ledger must report the TRUE gate outcome for notebook studies.

Before the fix, run_ledger.extract() mapped any stamped pipeline.ipynb to GATED
and only read UNGATED from solution.md (which notebook studies never produce).
So 3-strike (UNGATED) and failed closes were silently recorded as GATED. The
gate outcome is now persisted in nb.metadata.agentic.gate_outcome by
agent_runtime stamping; extract() must honor it.
