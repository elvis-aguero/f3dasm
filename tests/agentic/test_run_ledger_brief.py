"""run_ledger.analysis_brief: mechanical post-run digest.

Asserts it (a) offloads the MECHANICAL facts (KPI row, diagnostics tally,
verbatim ERROR_RETURN) and (b) RELOCATES the prose (retrospectives verbatim)
rather than classifying it — the line we must not cross is turning a
judgement (reading prose for varied failure-mode wording) into a proxy grep.
