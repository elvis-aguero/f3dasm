"""Run-1 back door: orphaned ledger rows from a killed/cancelled delegation.

A delegation flushes provenance-stamped rows into the canonical ledger DURING
execution, but the terminal record() (DONE/FAILED) is written only at
COMPLETION. A delegation cancelled or killed mid-flight (wall/eval budget) left
ledgered rows with NO log entry — orphan evals that (a) broke the provenance
audit trail the critic rejects on and (b) escaped the eval-budget counter (the
v1 1523-vs-1000 overrun).

Fix: a RUNNING entry is logged at DISPATCH; _load_all collapses last-wins so the
terminal record supersedes it, and a killed delegation keeps its RUNNING entry
(still traceable). These tests pin that behaviour.
