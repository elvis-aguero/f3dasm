"""The report-retry prompt is built from the agent's own report_sections.

Regression for run 20260708T021335 (D005/D007/D011): the static
IMPLEMENTER_REPORT_RETRY_PROMPT hardcoded 4 subsections and commanded "EXACTLY
this structure / do not skip any subsection", which would make a compliant
model DROP the implementer's 5th section, ### Retrospective — and was wrong for
the critic/lit-reviewer whose report_sections differ. The prompt must track
whatever sections the parser actually validates.
